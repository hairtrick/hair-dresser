<p>Isayama does use armin to voice the conventionally ethical side, meaning that normally, a woman in mikasa’s place should move on, yet in the end, mikasa is depicted as still wanting eren. The only reason people believe that will happen is because some readers see women as prizes to be won and since jean likes her, they expect them to end up together, even though they�ve barely interacted and mikasa has always been in love with eren. A number of fan theories suggest that jim cheated on pam during the office. There�s nothing in the manga that suggests they�re even friends, let alone they�ll end up marrying. Will Eren and Mikasa End Up Together? Or Will Eren Marry.</p>

<p>A number of fan theories suggest that jim cheated on pam during the office. There�s nothing in the manga that suggests they�re even friends, let alone they�ll end up marrying. Yes, eren does love mikasa as she is definitely the most important woman in his life after his mother. She does have a baby, but since the identity of her husband was never revealed, we don’t actually know if it’s jean, which means that we don’t know whether the baby is jean’s. So you’re telling me that in episode 45, Eren ends&hellip; Oh.</p>

<p>The ending sequence is literally the renewal of the vows of eternal love between eren and mikasa. Mikasa won’t end up with anyone. Their will they or won�t they situation drew in viewers throughout the first few seasons. I also doubt eren would expect his mom to end up dating and maybe marrying someone else which seems to be possible direction this is going in the recent chapter. Eren Jaeger Haircut Will Eren And Mikasa End Up Together.</p>
