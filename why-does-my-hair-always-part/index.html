<p>It is long and fine; The middle part has gained popularity in the past few years and is the quickest and easiest way to part your hair. Nope, my hair is considerably thicker on one side, so i part it on the side to make up for it. One of the best ways to get more moisture to your hair is to use specific moisturizing products on that section of hair. Does anyone think my hair might be curly? I shaved it not.</p>
