<p>According to muslim reported that anas (may allah be pleased with him) said, “the period that was pescribed for us to trim our moustache, clip our nails, pluck out our armpit hair and shave our pubic hair is forty days.” it means that we have to shave our pubic hair every 40 days. Well, men should not wear long hair. Men who are growing their hair long might consider switching from a barber to a hairstylist. If your hair is two inches long and you’re aiming for shoulder length (about 12 inches) growth, that adds up to a little less than two years to reach your goal. Goatee Man Choose the Right Style For Yourself!.</p>
