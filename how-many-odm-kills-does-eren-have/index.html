<p><strong>How Many Odm Kills Does Eren Have</strong>, Zeke can turn humans into pure titans and he can control them since he has a royal blood while eren currently holds three titan powers. Zekezeke is more powerful than eren while eren is stronger than zeke. Levi can�t even approach him because eren is too op right now. That�s kinda why i love the scene, because it shows everything that is eren�s character while showing you just how harsh and brutal the reality of the situation is.</p>

<p>Without eren, then they would be alive and frieda would still have the founding titan. He only has one titan kill in human form. That scene kinda sums it up, he sees one titan killing his friend and rushes into the fray without hesitation, hoping to kill a titan, and doesn�t pay attention to anything around him. Zekezeke is more powerful than eren while eren is stronger than zeke.</p>

<p>Eren has killed more than anyone else in the franchise, but he has mostly used his titan abilities to fight his enemies. Bertholdt hoover is a graduate of the 104th cadet corps, wherein he was ranked 3rd, and is a childhood friend of reiner braun. Levi’s squad was one of the best teams in the attack on titan series. That�s kinda why i love the scene, because it shows everything that is eren�s character while showing you just how harsh and brutal the reality of the situation is. Eren was born and raised in shiganshina district, which is located on the southern edge.</p>
