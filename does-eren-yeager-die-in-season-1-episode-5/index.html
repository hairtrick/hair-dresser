<p>Eren, driven insane by his quest, had become the world’s adversary some time before this ultimate battle. Because zeke caught eren before he passed on, eren teleports to the paths, where zeke is waiting for him. It�s an extremely bloody and disturbing scene. Any ordinary human would�ve died immediately from gabi�s shot, but eren�s titan power keeps him (barely) alive, so when zeke makes the catch (foreshadowed by his years of baseball practice in marley), the reunion still happens. Does Eren Die In Attack On Titan Season 2.</p>
