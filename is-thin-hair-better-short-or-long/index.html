<p>For straight hair that is fine and thin, i generally recommend a blunt cut, possibly angled forward slightly to be just a little longer in front than in the back. The most annoying part about having long hair is the fact that it gets stuck everywhere you go. Long layers create more texture and movement in your hair, helping to take the focus away from thinning. Attempting to grow the hair long in order to cover up thinning spots will often backfire, as the hair is typically still thin enough to see through to the balding area. 2019 Short Hairstyles &amp; Haircuts for Thin Hair Hair.</p>
