Attack on titan properly redeems a season 1 character. Yes, because eren is afflicted by ymir’s curse, which dictates that a titan shifter can only survive for 13 years after inheriting their powers. Will Eren Yeager Die in Attack on Titan Season 4?.</p>

<p>Eren dies at the very end of the series. Eren yeager is one of the main characters in hajime isayama’s manga attack on titan. The rest of this article is going to explain the circumstances under which eren yeager died. Any ordinary human would�ve died immediately from gabi�s shot, but eren�s titan power keeps him (barely) alive, so when zeke makes the catch (foreshadowed by his years of baseball practice in marley), the reunion still happens.
