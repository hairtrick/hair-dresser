<p>For those new to the natural hair community, protective styling involves putting your hair into a style that involves tucking your ends away from the atmosphere to protect them from damage whilst your hair grows. While, on one hand, protective styles like braids and twists (and even wigs) will give your hair a break when it comes to daily styling and manipulation, there’s kind of no way around the fact that they also can add extra tension on the most fragile parts of your hair—your edges and your nape. This is a great way to try out a variety of styles, colors, and lengths without doing anything permanent. As you are looking to extend the longevity of your protective style along with protecting your hair underneath, one of the most effective yet simplest ways to do so is by wearing a silk or satin bonnet at night and or using a silk or satin pillowcase.</p>
