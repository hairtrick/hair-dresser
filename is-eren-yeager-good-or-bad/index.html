<p><strong>Is Eren Yeager Good Or Bad</strong>, Eren yeager is the son of a well known medical scientist and a doctor, grisha yeager. Branding eren with one adjective or labeling him either a “villain” or “hero” doesn’t make sense. Eren is not supposed to be a great protagonist because he is just another victim of a world that consistently takes away his freedom. Eren yeager has seen the horrors of war and while his body count was low up until season 4, it�s clear that the whole affair with the titans has taken its toll on his psyche.</p>
