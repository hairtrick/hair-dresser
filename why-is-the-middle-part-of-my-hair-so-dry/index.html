<p>It can also be frustrating when your hair’s hemline is shaped like a w rather than a healthy u or v because of crown area and middle area breakage issues. There are many reasons why women experience female hair loss. Its been almost two weeks and i have no idea why my hairs are falling so much i ain’t using that shampoo any ore and is there any hair oil which will help….

<p>Unfortunately, this leaves us with a thirsty, achy section of scalp that is often thinning and breaking and screaming out for help while the rest of our tresses flourish. There are many reasons why women experience female hair loss. This can be achieved in most cases by using styling product and drying the hair with a blow dryer using a lifting action to create more volume in the hair at the back of the head. The middle of my hair in the crown is coarser, so i have to give it a moisture “bomb” everyday. Why is my hair so thin and fragile ? Elithairtransplant.</p>
