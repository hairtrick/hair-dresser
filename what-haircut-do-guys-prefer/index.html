<p>Popxo points to men favoring cute and/or messy pigtails, while stylecaster speaks of the appeal of more glamorous, sleeker updos, but these looks also require some length in order to pull off. Whether they prefer it neat and trimmed or downright smooth and bare, the bottom line is that they don�t want anything to get in the way. Here�s what men really think about pubes. More when i had super long (blonde) hair, though. Which one do you prefer???.</p>
