<p>Always make sure you brush your hair before you go to bed at night. This is something you can do in less than a minute, but will certainly help protect your hair. This overnight hair curler is a brilliant hair tool, designed to be worn overnight to protect and curl your hair. If you have chosen to opt for heavier braided styles such as marley braids or box braids, use the ‘pineapple wrap’ method to keep them up and away from your back and pillow. How to grow out your grey hair Gray hair growing out.</p>
