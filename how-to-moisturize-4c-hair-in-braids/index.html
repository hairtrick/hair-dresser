<p>Oil your scalp with stimulating oils while your hair is in braids. Hot oil treatments will help the oils to be deposited into the hair and prevent dryness that can lead to breakage. How do i moisturize my daily braids? Two of the best ways to moisturize your hair under a protective style is to spritz your hair with a mixture of water and a light oil, such as olive oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil, on a daily basis.
