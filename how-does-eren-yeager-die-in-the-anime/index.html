<p>In the newly released episode, fans can watch eren running toward his brother after he unleashed his titan attack, with the protagonist trying to outrun reiner once he managed to. Any ordinary human would�ve died immediately from gabi�s shot, but eren�s titan power keeps him (barely) alive, so when zeke makes the catch (foreshadowed by his years of baseball practice in marley), the reunion still happens. Eren is a teenager who swears revenge on enormous creatures known as titans that devoured his mother and destroyed his town in the shiganshina district in wall maria. Attack on titan episode 78 saw eren and zeke finally reach each other after trying to reunite since the beginning of season 4 part 2. Eren Yeager Anime Amino.</p>
