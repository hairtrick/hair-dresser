<p>You will not be able to see it unless you pluck the hair out of your head. Hair is made of a tough protein called keratin. The cells of this region also elongate and bring about growth in the length of the root. In conifers the root hairs of short roots arise from a surface layer of cells, whereas those of long roots arise from the second or third layer of cortical cells. These root hairs are known to facilitate and encourage water absorption.</p>
