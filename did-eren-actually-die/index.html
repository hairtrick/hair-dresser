<p>Little did she know that this would actually accelerate eren’s monstrous transformation. However, fans are not yet convinced the protagonist is dead. Episode 78 of the final season of attack on titan saw eren jaeger have his head blown off, but the character may not be dead for long because his brother zeke wants to use the founder�s power to. The final 3 chapters seem to be focused on armin mikasa and eren in that order, and eren�s been decapitated twice in the series so far. Why do people still argue Eren is the father after these.</p>
