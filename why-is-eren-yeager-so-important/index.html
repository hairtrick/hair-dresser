Attack on Titan Why Eren &amp; Jean’s Reactions to THAT Death From cbr.com</p>
<p>First, i tried it with school. Attack on titan is the story of eren yeager. After becoming a titan, eren already knows that he does not have much time left. His idealism is stripped away with the first assault of the colossal and armored titans, leading to the fall shinganshina and death of eren’s mother, amongst many others.</p>

<p>The answer is not so simple, in a world of relativity. Eren yeager is the existing receptacle of the founding titan and the attack titan. Floch is also the only person who fully understands eren�s plan, he sees eren as a saviour, but although they have the same goal they act for different interests, floch in fact wants to destroy marley to restore splendour to the great eldia empire, eren instead wants freedom, absolute freedom for himself and his friends, and suffers in doing what he does, he knows that killing is. There are even more effective ways to achieve peace. Basically, their image of eren was so solidified that this new eren couldn’t really be digested by them.</p>
